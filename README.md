-**[Keywords-based](https://github.com/Ram-N/generative_art/blob/main/daily_sketches/keywords.md)** Daily sketches sorted based on certain keywords I use to group them.


*Note: I use p5.js. When I use Processing, it is almost always in the Python Mode.*

This is a repo to store several GenArt attempts. I use either p5, or Processing (in Python mode) to create art sketches.

This is a meta-repo, in the sense that it is a directory of directorys. Each sub-directory in the repo has the `code` as well as a set of `images` in the images directory (where applicable). The README.md in each directory explains what that particular experiment was about.

I try to make all my code available and runnable by others. There are many parameters that you can change and try to get your own results.

### Metro Maps | [Code](/metro_maps) | [images](metro_maps/images)

An experimental project that creates Metro Maps for imaginary cities.

What would the Metro (subway) map look like, for imaginary cities? Each time the code is run, it produces a
different set of Terminals, Routes, Junctions and Stations.

### Ball Animations | [Code](/ball_animations) | [images](ball_animations/images)

A series of sketches on balls colliding, as well as balls dodging each other, avoiding collisions.

Please look through the directories in this repo, and check out the `images` folder in each. There are many 'experiments' for which I haven't yet added the descriptions.
